                            <li>Alumni are assigned different tasks based on seniority. A "level one" alumni is the most recent graduate from a CSO team. All other alumni are considered "level two" alumni. Level one alumni serve as mentors to their alma mater CSO team. Level two alumni serve as consultants for the regional cabinet closest to where they currently reside. Only level two alumni are eligible to nominate for a board position, however all alumni are eligible to vote.</li>

                            <li>There is no set number of members for the alumni board, so the composition of the board may be fluid depending on interest. To try for a position on the board, a level two alumni must first self nominate. After recieving unanimous approval from the board and a majority vote from the association, the member may be inducted. Board positions have no term lengths or limits, so a board confirmation must be made deliberately.</li>
